# ContentGenerator

An internal AI-powered content system for transforming inspiration into brand-safe, platform-optimized marketing content.

This project is designed to help manage multiple brands by converting existing inspiration (ads, captions, visuals) into original content that strictly follows each brand’s tone, positioning, and creative rules.

## Core Concept

Instead of prompting AI manually, this system treats **brands as structured data** and **content as a transformation problem**.

The system:
1. Analyzes inspiration content (structure, emotion, CTA style)
2. Rebuilds it using brand-specific rules
3. Outputs original, brand-safe content
4. Supports presets, batch generation, and future image generation
